Dataset ideas: City preparedness for climate change-related natural disasters: predict potential deaths, mental health in relation to climate change (eco-anxiety), human migration in response to climate change (climate refugees).

Questions for reviewers: 
Do you think a prediction based project or analysis would be better for this topic?
What if we can't find sufficient information after we commit to a topic?
Can we/how would we go about combining separate, unrelated datasets?
